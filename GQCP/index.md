# The Ghent Quantum Chemistry Package

Welcome to the home page of the Ghent Quantum Chemistry Package, GQCP for short.


## Why?

At GQCG, we strongly believe that every complex problem can be solved. Calculating the electronic structure is one of them. From the combination of our passion for quantum chemistry and open-source software, GQCP saw its first light in 2017 and has been growing ever since. 

But why does our quantum chemistry community need yet another electronic structure code? While other code bases might have better performance than GQCP, GQCP is modern at its core. GQCP is natively written in C++, so we have access to the most modern software techniques and compilers. GQCPY is its Python-bounded counterpart, so we fully embrace Python's present role as data manipulating language. Gone are the days of providing input files or writing executables, with GQCPY and Jupyter Notebooks you can naturally adapt a work flow that is both playful and systematic at the same time.


## Documentation

If you are mainly interested in how to use the code and its Python bindings, we would like you to go through the [Python documentation page](python_documentation.md).

If you would like to know how the C++ library works under the hood, we kindly point you to the [C++ documentation page](cpp_documentation.md).
